### USING CUSTOM PATTERNS:

- This Mod allows the user to load their own Custom Haptic Patterns.
- You can create Custom Haptic Patterns by exporting the ``.tact`` file from the [bHaptics Designer](https://designer.bhaptics.com/).

1) Place the ``.tact`` file next to the Config file of the Pattern you would like to replace.  
For example if you wanted to replace the ``HeartBeat`` on the ``Vest`` you would place it in ``UserData\bHaptics\Player\Vest``

2) Rename the ``.tact`` file to the name of the Config file of the Pattern you would like to replace.  
For example if you wanted to replace the ``HeartBeat`` you would rename it to ``HeartBeat.tact``
